Scripts are labelled in the order they were used.

Script 1 prepares the data and the Bayesian model (output as a text file) for analyses.

Script 2 fits the Bayesian model, for each country. It was run on a HPC plateform.

Script 3 used the output of the model to analyse how the proportion of zeros (missing interactions) varies with the sampling pressure.

Script 4 extracts the mechanisms (trait complementarity and exploitation barrier) from the model, to do Figure 2.

Script 5 was used to predict a the interaction network for each site.

Script 6 studies how trait distributions (bill and corolla lengths) vary across sites and how it translates to proportion of forbidden links.

Script 7 performs robustness simulations and analyse the output, to estimate the effect of forbidden links on robustness.
